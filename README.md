# email-charter
I've used the [Email Charter](https://gmcressman.github.io/email-charter/) in my email signature for years. I created this repository when the original emailcharter.org website expired. Yes, this has been posted on [Medium](https://medium.com/virtual-teams-for-systemic-change/the-email-charter-an-idea-worth-spreading-688b8940f892) also, but I thought it might be useful to have it here on GitHub.  

The Email Charter was created in response to widespread acknowledgement that email is getting out of hand for many people. It started life as a [blog post](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315012653/http://tedchris.posthaven.com/help-create-an-email-charter)  by TED Curator **Chris Anderson** and TED Scribe **Jane Wulf**. The idea struck a chord. More than 45,000 people read the post and and it generated hundreds of tweets, comments and suggestions. That is how the final Charter was shaped. Some of the key contributors are listed [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315012653/http://emailcharter.org/comments.html).

The Charter is a private, non-commercial initiative, a simple ‘idea worth spreading’.

Thank you!
